# ONLINE-BUS-SYSTEM
An Online Bus System is basically an app or website where you can:
Find Buses, See Schedules, Pick Your Seat, Buy Tickets, Get Your Ticket 
For Bus Companies:
It helps them keep track of their buses, routes, and how many seats are left.
They can easily change prices or schedules.
It saves them money because they don't need as many people selling tickets in person.
